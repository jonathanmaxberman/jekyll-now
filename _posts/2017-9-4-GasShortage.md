title: Gas Shortage!
---

  One of the Hurricane Harvey did extensive damage up and down the Texas coast, killing dozens, destroying billions of dollars worth of property and causing immense suffering.
  
  San Antonio didn't really get hit. We got some heavy rain on and off for a few days, and there were some power outages, but in context it was nothing to complain about. Of course, it could easily have been us. For a while Harvey edged closer to SA and it looked like it might park over us for days, giving us the same treatment that Houston got. We got off lucky. Almost everyone I know is doing *something* for relief efforts-- donating blood, donating money, donating time and effort clearing drywall in flooded homes. 
  
  Possibly the most irritating consequence for us so far has been the gas shortage. It's not that the supply of gas has actually gone down, but a confluence of factors have resulted in an effective shortage of gas. 
  * Increased Demand
  
  Right before Harvey made landfall, everyone filled their tanks (this is the general advice everyone gives prior to a hurricane). At some point over the weekend, a degree of panic set in and rumors of a gas shortage spread on social media. This lead to long lines at gas pumps which fueled belief in a gas shortage. Now the set point of "when to fill up" changed from half a tank, or a quarter tankm, to any value. Gas sale went to 2.5x normal volume.
  It was also labor day weekend, which is typically a time of high demand. 
  
  * Decreased Supply
  
  Some gas shipments have apparently been diverted to recovery efforts in Houston. Under normal demand this would likely have not been noticed.
  
  Now we're in a weird disequillybrium. As sson as a gas delivery comes in, cars line up and buy all the fuel. Demand is so high, and supply so low that 
  
  Hopefully things get back to equillybrium in the next couple of weeks, but it is strange to see how quickly normal services can be disrupted, not by the forces of nature, but by panic and selfishness.
