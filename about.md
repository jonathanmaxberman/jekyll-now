I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, where I study the molecular origins of hypertension. I was a national co-chair of the march for science that took place on April 22, 2017. I once tried to run a cactus for mayor of San Antonio. I was a stand up comedian for nine years. Everyone says my dog is adorable.
